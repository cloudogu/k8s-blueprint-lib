// BlueprintMaskV1 describes an abstraction of CES components that should alter a blueprint definition before
// applying it to a CES system via a blueprint upgrade. The blueprint mask should not change the blueprint JSON file
// itself, but is applied to the information in it to generate a new effective blueprint.
//
// In general additions without changing the version are fine, as long as they don't change semantics. Removal or
// renaming are breaking changes and require a new blueprint mask API version.
